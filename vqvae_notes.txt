VQVAE - Neural Discrete Representation Learning

loss functions for VAE
- maximum likelihood
- reconstruction loss

K embeddings (vectors) of dimensionality D
x => encoder => z_e(x)
z => nearest neighbour look-up (using shared embedding space e, i.e. q(z = k|x) = 1 for k = argmin_j||z_e(x) - e_j||_2, 0 otherwise)
z_q(x) is the input of the decoder: z_q(x) = e_k, where k = argmin_k||z_e(x) - e_j||_2
like classic VAE with a mapping of the latents to 1-of-K embedding vectors
